Project Description:

Everyone experiences sadness and unhappiness at some point in their lives. Clinical Depression, however, is more intense and of longer duration than typical sadness or grief, which interferes with a person's ability to engage in daily activities. The symptoms of depression can include: loss of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, major changes in appetite (either significantly reduced or increased), sleep problems (sleeping too much or too little), fatigue, a feeling of worthlessness or hopelessness, problems with concentration and making decisions, and thoughts of suicide. This mental disorder is common and the percentage of people suffering from depression varies according to countries.
depression is a widespread mental health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. While it can have a profound impact on individuals and society, it is treatable and manageable with appropriate interventions. Increasing awareness, reducing stigma, improving access to care, and advancing research are critical steps in addressing depression as a common mental disorder.In this project we are trying to analyze the depression data for different countries and extract some insights from the data using Business Intelligence tools. To Extract the Insights from the data and put the data in the form of visualizations, Dashboards and Story we employed Tableau tool.
